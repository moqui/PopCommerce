===========================================================================
Release 2.0.0 - 22 Oct 2017
===========================================================================

POP Commerce Retail and Wholesale ERP and eCommerce 2.0.0 is a major
new feature and bug fix release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework version 2.1.0, mantle-udm 2.0.0,
mantle-usl 2.0.0, and SimpleScreens 2.0.0. It also uses the
moqui-elasticsearch 1.1.0 and moqui-fop 1.1.0 tool components.

With this release the POP Commerce Admin (ERP) application has sufficient
functionality for real world use out of the box as a business management
and ecommerce administration system for retail, wholesale, and distribution
companies. This is thanks to a company who decided not just to use POP
Commerce but also to contribute all generic functionality they needed to
PopCommerce and related Moqui Ecosystem projects.

Some basic stats to show just how much new there is:

- Screens: 153 (last release 71)
- Forms: 464 (last release 210)

The admin app has new screens from SimpleScreens for comprehensive general
party, request, returns, and wiki/content management.

The ecommerce app (/popc) has a new content screen which is the root page
for managed content pages that can be added and edited (with version
history and published version management) in the admin app, along with
attachments, for display on the ecommerce site.

There are significant improvements in accounting including various new
and improved reports and period closing automation.

With the Mantle integrations for Authorize.NET and Shippo, and various user
interface changes, the admin app also supports full payment processing and
shipping/labels processes.

Release 1.0.1 - 17 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

POP Commerce 1.0.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework version 1.6.0, Mantle Business
Artifacts version 1.2.0, and SimpleScreens version 1.0.0.

While there are a few new screens and improvements to the admin and
ecommerce apps the main changes in this release are quality related. There
are now screen render tests, run on every git push though Travis CI, and
there were various fixes and improvements done while writing these tests.

Many screens (around 4800 lines) were moved to the SimpleScreens project
for more generic reuse. These changes help POP Commerce focus on being an
industry specific suite of applications while making it easier for other
applications to reuse more generic functionality that was in POP Commerce.
POP Commerce also no longer depends on HiveMind with this move to
SimpleScreens.

The eCommerce application currently has 16 screens and 20 forms. The admin
application currently has 71 screens and 210 forms. POP Commerce has around
3.7k lines of text, mostly in XML files (a small number in FTL, Groovy).

New Features

- Added screen render tests, initially 80 renders
- Added Travis CI configuration and setup automated builds
- Various cleanups and fixes done while screen testing
- Added financial reports based on newer report templates in SimpleScreens
  and services in Mantle, improved existing reports; now includes Balance
  Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Income Statement, Retained Earnings, and
  Financial Ratios/Metrics
- Now uses the SimpleScreens project instead of HiveMind for Accounting,
  Vendor, etc screens (new dependency on SimpleScreens, no longer depends
  on HiveMind)
- Added simple Category screen in ecommerce app

Bug Fixes
